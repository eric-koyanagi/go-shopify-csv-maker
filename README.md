# Go Shopify CSV Maker
This creates a CSV filled with dummy product data for Shopify. 

It can generate any number of products, but be aware that Shopify has a 15 MB limit. You can use another tool (like this project https://github.com/eric-koyanagi/go-shopify-csv-helper) to split up larger CSVs -- I allow it to create large CSVs so I can easily test a tool like this.
